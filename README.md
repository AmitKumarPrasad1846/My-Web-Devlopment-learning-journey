# My Coding Journey 🚀

Welcome to my learning repo!  
Here you'll find all my projects, notes, and practice code as I build my skills in:

- ✅ HTML
- 🚧 CSS
- 🧠 JavaScript
- 📊 SQL
- 🤖 AI & Machine Learning (Coming soon...)

This is the **beginning of my dream to build something massive.**  
I'm not perfect. I'm not fast.  
But I am *relentless.* 💥
